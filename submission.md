# Submission Notes

These notes will be read by HubSpot developers. Drop us a line!

## Given more time, what would you have done differently?

Would love to have worked on the CSS and Search filters a bit more

## How did you deviate from the directions, if at all, and why?

Was unable to install or run the original repo - initially spent 2 days trying to reconfigure it and decided to rebuild in React/node/webpack. 

Really enjoyed the react build, not so much working with EJS. 

Met as many requirements as possible.

## Is there anything else you'd like to let us know?

Thanks for your time / consideration!
